<p id="home_p">An employee review, also known as a performance appraisal, is a regular evaluation of an employee's job performance
    by their employer or supervisor. It provides constructive feedback on their strengths, areas for improvement, and
    overall contributions to the organization. Employee reviews are essential for setting performance goals, recognizing
    outstanding achievements, and promoting continuous growth and development. By actively participating in the review
    process, employees can gain valuable insights into their performance, seek opportunities for improvement, and work
    towards enhancing their skills and capabilities. Regular feedback and open communication during reviews contribute
    to a positive and motivated work environment, fostering employee engagement and overall organizational success.</p>
